	<h1> IFMP Database Application </h1>
	<p> I was asked to create this application in the summer of 2015 in order to help a
	nonprofit organization <a href="http://www.ifmpnj.org/"> India Foundation of Metropolitan 
	Princeton </a> keep track of its members. I wrote this application in VB.Net
	and it access a MSSQL database. This project taught me a lot about meeting 
	specifications and how to create a UI that would be intuitive and simple to use for
	the user. Up until this project I was mostly coding things that used the command 
	line, so creating a GUI was a good learning experience. 
	</p>
	<p>
	IFMP needed a more efficient way to store and access their members list compared to 
	the method they were using at the time which was to collaborate the membership 
	information collected by multiple people into an excel spreadsheet that had to be 
	maintained manually. This was important because members had to pay annual dues and 
	having an outdated membership list could cause a lot of problems or people could say 
	they had paid when they really hadn’t, but if the membership list wasn’t current they 
	would be let in. To solve this problem I created a MSSQL database to store information 
	about each member such as First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Family Size (membership 
	would cost different amounts based on this), Address etc. Using a VB.Net front end 
	users can access this database and easily lookup members by name, last name or an ID 
	Column field then easily update the information of the member and send those updates 
	back to the database, no excel sheets involved! 
	</p>
	<p>Working on this project taught me a lot about software design and development as 
	well as testing and debugging. I had only worked on assignments in my classes which 
	required the command line and had never made a GUI/Front end to any of the work I had 
	done. It was a great learning experience to develop the user interface that would make 
	it easy for someone to interact with my code and it also was something I had not done 
	before this project. I also learned some basic SQL from this project as well as how to 
	send emails from this application to certain members based on criteria ( for example 
	sending an email to everyone who was inactive asking them to renew their membership). 
	I still do work on it today if the organization needs new features added although for 
	the most part the application is complete.
	<br />
	I will outline some	of the features of this program below. The features listed below 
	are not all the features of the project because I am still working on documenting them. 
	Some features also include the ability to save the contents	of the membership table to 
	an excel sheet, send emails using SMTP/Gmail/EAGetMail to members in the database using 
	the email address field	based upon certain criteria (IE if they are members are nonmembers) 
	and resizable mode (two options 1080 x 720 and 1548 x 825). I will get around to documenting 
	all the features of the application.
	</p>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Login.png">
	<br />
	<p>
	This is the basic login screen. You can log onto this application as either a user or
	an administrator.
	</p>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Login2.png">
	<br />
	<p>
	This is the screen that allows you to log into the database. You will need to have
	your IP address added to a list of IP's addressed allowed to access the database before 
	you can use this application. If your IP address isn't on that list then you cannot 
	proceed	further.
	</p>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/MainUI1.png">
	<br />
	<p>
	This is the main user interface. It contains many features that I will go over. For
	demonstration purposes I have excluded all actual members and am just using fake
	members I created named test one and test two. A feature of this application is the 
	ability	to search for members by either typing part of their first/last name or 
	typing their ID into the corresponding textboxes.
	</p>
	<h3> First Name Search </h3>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Search1.png">
	<h3> Last Name Search </h3>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Search2.png">
	<h3> Id Search </h3>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Search3.png">
	<br />
	<p>
	A user may click on the ID column of any member and autofill the textboxes with the
	data stored in the database corresponding to that member. </p>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/ID Complete.gif">
	<br />
	<p>
	A user may fill in textboxes then press update in order to update the information
	stored in the database. </p>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Update_Example.gif">
	<br />
	<h3> Add Member </h3>
	<p>
	This is the Add Member interface. ID Number is filled in automatically by checking the existing
	ID's and adding + to previous highest number. Default Event/Payment/Channel are filled in automatically
	by reading in from the settings table. The user must enter a First/Last name for each member as well as
	an email address. 
	</p>
	<br />
	<img src="Images/IFMP Database App/Add Member.png">
	<br />
	<img src="Images/IFMP Database App/AddMember_Restriction.gif">
	<br />
	<img src="Images/IFMP Database App/AddMember_EmailRestrict.gif">
	<br />
	<p>
	When all fields have been filled out as desired, a Welcome Email will be sent to the member containing
	information about the Organization and their membership ID/information we have stored about them in
	the database. This is doing using SMTPServer and Gmail. 
	</p>
	<br />
	<img src="Images/IFMP Database App/Welcome Email.png">
	<br />
	<h3> Tables </h3>
	<p>
	The main table being used is called membership. 
	The defaults table is used to store default values for event/channel/payment method that will be
	autofilled when add member is called. The user can press menu->settings->set default event/channel/payment. 
	The defaults table will then be updated with the currently selected value for any of these three combo boxes. </p>
	<h3> Default Table Structure </h3>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Tables/DefaultsTable.png">
	<br />
	<h3> Setting Default Event </h3>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Tables/SetDefaultEvent.gif">
	<br />
	<p>
	The values that can be chosen are based off three other tables,
	Events/Channels/PaymentMethods. Each of these tables contain one field (Events/Channels/PaymentMethods) which are primary key and are sorted in ascneding order.
	Below is an example of the event table, however the Channel and Payment tables are the same. 
	</p>
	<h3> Event Table Structure </h3>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Tables/EventsTable.png">
	<br />
	<h3> Event Table Contents </h3>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Tables/EventsTableContents.png">
	<br />
	<p> The following code will initalize the EventBox combo box based on the contents of the Events Table. Of course, the same
	method is called to initialize the Payment/Channel combo boxes. </p>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Tables/InitializeEventBox.png">
	<br />
	<p>	When the application loads or add member is called, the following code will execute to find the current default values
	for the Event/Payment/Channel boxes and set the value to the defaults. For Payment/Channel, the select statement is just
	select [Default Payment] / [Default Channel] </p>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Tables/SetDefaultEventBox.png">
	<br />
	<h3> Below you find the structure of the tables used in my application </h3>	
	<h3> Membership Table </h3>

	<h1> Pokemon Snowdown Project </h1>
	<p>
	I worked on this project as part of one of my classes, Introduction to Open Source, 
	and continued working on it beyond that class. <a href="https://github.com/Phansa/PokeSnowdown/blob/master/Documentation/CSCI-2963-01/PokeSnowdown_Presentation_FINAL.pdf"> Here </a> is a nice 
	presentation on what we	contributed to this project as part of that class. 
	The project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Phansa/PokeSnowdown"> here</a>.
	I created the <a href="https://github.com/Phansa/PokeSnowdown/wiki">wiki</a> for this 
	project documenting the features of the game as well
	as how to install the game. I would like more people to contribute to this project
	if possible, so I added some pages on how people can get involved. This is a Pokemon 
	battle simulator written in OCaml that requires a linux machine/virtual machine
	to run. Here are some images of what the game interface looks like.

	<p> I had created an Excel spreadsheet of all of the League of Legends skins I owned and
	wanted a way to visually display them somehow. Skins in League of Legends are 
	customizations that change the way certain characters look in game that are purchaseable for
	money. There isn't really a method built-in into the game to see all of the skins you 
	currently own. I decided to manually go through each champion(character in the game) I
	owned and look through the skins I had for them and record them into an Excel 
	spreadsheet so I knew what I owned. I wanted to learn how to use the Riot API,
	so I figured I may as well make a program to read the skins I own and generate 
	an HTML page containing the artwork of each skin. The source code for this
	program can be be found <a href="https://github.com/Phansa/Phansa.github.io/blob/master/main.py"> here
	</a>.
	I used a template program from a Youtube video I found in order understand how the the API
	worked first, then started working on what I wanted to do. Part of this program reads
	an Excel spreadsheet in as input and outputs a result Excel spreadsheet. This was 
	necessary because when accessing the API I used an exact string match to find out
	if I owned a champion skin, but in my own Excel spreadsheet I had only written the
	first part of a skin name (for example Frostfire Annie was just Frostfire) and thus
	I needed to append the second part(the champion name) to multiple cells in my source excel spreadsheet.
	Instead of doing this manually, I did it programatically and afterwards double checked
	to remove some unncessary additions (for example Snowmerdinger is the correct string and
	Snowmerdinger Heimerdinger is the incorrect string so I had to fix these cases). Then reading
	in my new Excel spreadsheet, I looped through each champion in the JSON response file 
	then each skins	field of each champion to find out the unique number associated with each skin.
	This number is used to in the image urls to identify which skin is which, so 
	for example Justicar Aatrox is the number 1
	<a href="http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/loading/Aatrox_1.jpg">
	http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/loading/Aatrox_1.jpg" </a>
	and the default Aatrox skin is the number 0
	<a href="http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/loading/Aatrox_0.jpg">
	http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/loading/Aatrox_0.jpg </a>.
	These URLS are saved into a list that I write to my output HTML file at the very end.
	I use insertion sort to make sure this list in alphabetical order. </p>
	<p>I can expand upon this project in two ways, first would be to style the HTML page
	/ make it more interesting. Second I could make a program that would generate the Skins
	Excel spreadsheet using data from a user's League of Legends client (as that is the place
	where the skin data is stored) and then use that generated Excel spreadsheet to make
	an HTML page and host it on my website. Another option would be to create
	a webform people can fill out containing all skins in the game then use the response to
	make an Excel spreadsheet, run my HTML generating program locally, then finally
	upload the page to my website/send the person who submitted the URL a link to their
	very own skins page. This method requires that the user will go through all the champions
	/skins they own however so it's more time consuming than being able to access the information
	directly from their client, however it requires less from a user because they wouldn't have to 
	install an application/can do it all from the web. This would be a valuable service to 
	the League of Legends community	as currently there isn't a very intuitive way to see 
	all the skins you have owned at once and I look forward to working on it some more

	<h1> Data Structures and Algorithms </h1>
	<p> These are programs I have written to practice various Data Structures and
	Algorithms concepts. They can be found on my Github <a href="https://github.com/Phansa/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Practice"> here </a>. There are also
	solutions to various Hackerank/Leetcode problems I have solved in my free time.

	<h1> Open Source </h1>
	<p> I have worked a lot with the Open Source community, both in being an undergraduate programming
	mentor for the class Introduction to Open Source at RPI as well as contributing to external open source projects.
	Notably I created a <a href="https://github.com/rcos/CSCI2963-01-Spring2017/blob/master/Spring2017StudyGuide.md"> study guide </a> to
	help students with Quiz 1. </p>
	<p>
	I have made contributions to the open source project LEGUP - a logic helper/puzzle software. I was taken an Introduction to Logic class
	and had to use this software and noticed it was on Github and had an issue I felt I could work on, changing the 
	background of the tile squares so that they could be clearly distinguishable from the lighted up squares
	for a light up puzzle game (<a href="https://github.com/Bram28/LEGUP/issues/78"> issue </a>). After looking through the codebase and
	trying to understand what files to change, I was able to implement this feature and get my code
	merged back into the master branch <a href="https://github.com/Bram28/LEGUP/commits?author=Phansa">(contributions)</a>.

	As part of the Rensselaer Center for Open Source I worked on ZNC Self Message modules , info can be found <a href="https://rcos.io/projects/zwimer/mutable-client-buffer/profile"> here </a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	I also have contributed to the ZNC <a href="https://github.com/znc/znc"> repository </a> helping with some documentation so that
	other developers could have an easier time.
