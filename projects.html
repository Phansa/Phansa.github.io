	<h1> IFMP Database Application </h1>
	<p> I was asked to create this application in the summer of 2015 in order to help this
	nonprofit organization keep track of its members. I wrote this application in VB.Net
	and it access a MSSQL database. This project taught me a lot about meeting 
	specifications and how to create a UI that would be intuitive and simple to use for
	the user. Up until this project, I was mostly coding things that used the command 
	line only so creating a GUI was a good learning experience. I will outline some
	of the features of this program here.
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Login.png">
	<br />
	This is the basic login Screen. You can log onto this application as either a user or
	and administrator.
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Login2.png">
	<br />
	This is the screen that allows you to log into the database. You will need to have
	your IP added to a list of IP's allowed to access the database before you can use 
	this application however. If your ip isn't on that list then you cannot proceed 
	further.
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/MainUI1.png">
	<br />
	This is the main user interface. It contains many features that I will go over. For
	demonstration purposes I have excluded all actual members and am just using fake
	membesr I created named test one and test two. A feature of this application are the 
	ability	to search for members by either typing part of their first/last name or 
	typing their ID into the corresponding textboxes.
	</p>
	<h3> First Name Search </h3>

	<h3> Last Name Search </h3>
	<br />

	<h3> Id Search </h3>
	<br />
	<img src="images/IFMP Database App/Search3.png">
	<br />
	<p>
	A user may click on the ID column of any member and autofill the textboxes with the
	data stored in the database corresponding to that member.
	<br />

	<br />
	A user may fill in textboxes then press update in order to update the information
	stored in the database.

	I worked on this project as part of one of my classes, Intro to Open Source, and 
	continued working on it beyond that class. The project can be found
