        I have worked on an open source project called Pokemon Snowdown. This game is a 
        Pokemon battle simulator that allows players to test their Pokemon battling sklls 
        against the CPU. I have created the whole wiki for this game, which can be found 
        <a href="https://github.com/Phansa/PokeSnowdown/wiki"> here </a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also created a database application in Visual Basic to keep track of 
        membership information for India Foundation of Metropolitan Princeton. 
        More details about both of those projects can be found <a href="projects.html">
        here </a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked on another open source Pokemon game simulator, 
        <a href="https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/FullScreenPokemon"> 
        FullScreen Pokemon </a> which is a TypeScript implementation of the original Pokemon 
        games with an emphasis on extensibility  and modularity. I worked on various parts of 
        the game engine, fixed some bugs and even animated some moves! It is a very cool and ambitious project and
        I would encourage you to check it out or even contribute to it!
      </p>
      <p>
        I am always working on various websites and hosting them on github, here a few of my most recent ones.

        Referral Links
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="http://share.robinhood.com/adeetp"> Robinhood </a> - a trading platform with zero 
      commissions or hidden fees giving you more freedom to trade on your own terms! By using
      my referral link to sign up you will get a free stock (no deposit necessary!) that will be worth
      around $3. This is a great way to start investing since you can put small amounts of
      money in over time. Using traditional brokers, you would be paying $5 a trade which adds up fast
      when you are investing small sums! As an example, with a $100 investment you would be paying $5
      to buy the stock and $5 to sell it, a whole 10% just in fees! Your investment would have to grow > 10%
      to even see a return. Robinhood eliminates the fees and democratizes trading. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a2d737170c47e00c72fa81d"> Coinbase </a> - a trading platform
        for cryptocurrencies. This is one of the largest websites in the United States that allows you to buy and sell
        some of the top cryptocurrencies. If you sign up using my link and buy $100 of any cryptocurrency,
        you will get $10 of bitcoin for free! The whole cryptocurrency world is highly volatile so I would suggest
        putting only as much money as you are willing to lose and not any money you will need in a short
        time frame. Invest responsibly!
      </p>

        Note - It is not my intent to provide any investment advice and you should consider the risks
        of any financial investment. I enjoy using these two services a lot and think they can provide
        benefit to a lot of people!
