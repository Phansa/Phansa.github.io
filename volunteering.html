				<h1> Volunteering </h1>
				<h2> India Foundation of Metropolitan Princeton Youth Group </h2>
				<p>
					I helped start a volunteering group in December 2012 to give back to the 
					Indian community. It was a lot of work to start the youth group with my 
					friends but I would say it was a very fun experience. As part of this group, 
					we would go to various local nursing homes and perform a music/dance show to 
					entertain the senior citizens there. Today it's still active and new people 
					have joined the group so I would say that it was successful. Our
					website can be found <a href="http://ifmpyouth.webs.com/"> here </a>.
					I was invited to give a speech at the Ekal Vidyalaya national conference 
					about how other people could start similiar youth groups and give back to their 
					communities.

				<h2> March of Dimes </h2>
				<p>
					I also helped volunteer with the organization March of Dimes which helps prevent 
					premature births and provides support for premature babies. As part of this 
					organization I was asked to raise money	for an annual event known as Rangeela, an 
					Indian cultural show in the local community. I made a promotional video for this event 
					as well.

				<p>
				To raise money I went to local businsses and asked if they would want to sponsor the event. 
				There were various sponsorship levels and each had different benefits.
				</p>

				 ></iframe>
				<p>
					I raised money for both the 2013 and 2012 events and over the course of both these 
					events I managed to raise over $4000! This money surely went a long way towards 
					preventing premature births and I am very proud that I was able to raise this amount
				    of money. I learned a lot about how to work in a team, pitch the idea of sponsorship
					to companies and also about the cause of premature births. I visited one of the 
					neo-natal intensive care units in a local hospital and I saw firsthand the type of 
					intensive care that is needed to treat these premature babies and it gave me a good 
					perspective of where all my hard work was going to.

					RPI and how the Computer Science department is / how the classes are here to prospective students. It was a lot of fun!
