<h1> Volunteering </h1>
<p>
	I helped start a volunteering group in December 2012 to give back to the Indian community. 
	It was a lot of work to start the youth group with my friends but I would say it
	was a very fun experience. As part of this group, we would go to various local nursing homes
	and perform a music/dance show to entertain the senior citizens there. Today it's still active 
	and new people have joined the group so I would say that it was successful. Our
	website can be found <a href="http://ifmpyouth.webs.com/"> here </a>.
	I was invited to give a speech at the Ekal Vidyalaya national conference about how other
	people could start similiar youth groups and give back to their communities.
