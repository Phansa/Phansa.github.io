<h1> Volunteering </h1>
<p>
	I helped start a volunteering group in December 2012 to give back to the Indian community. 
	It was a lot of work to start the youth group with my friends but I would say it
	was a very fun experience. As part of this group, we would go to various local nursing homes
	and perform a music/dance show to entertain the senior citizens there. Today it's still active 
	and new people have joined the group so I would say that it was successful. Our
	website can be found <a href="http://ifmpyouth.webs.com/"> here </a>.
	I was invited to give a speech at the Ekal Vidyalaya national conference about how other
	people could start similiar youth groups and give back to their communities.

I also helped volunteer with the organization March of Dimes which helps prevent premature births
and provides support for premature babies. As part of this organization I was asked to raise money
for an annual event known as Rangeela, an Indian cultural show in the local community. I made a promotional
video for this event as well.

<p>
To raise money I went to local businsses and asked if they would want to sponsor the event. There were various
sponsorship levels and each had different benefits.

	I raised money for both the 2013 and 2012 events and over the course of both these events I managed to raise
	over $4000! This money surely went a long way towards preventing premature births and I am very proud that
	I was able to raise this amount of money. I learned a lot about how to work in a team, pitch the idea of sponsorship
	to companies and also about the cause of premature births. I visited one of the neo-natal intensive care units
	in a local hospital and I saw firsthand the type of intensive care that is needed to treat these premature babies
	and it gave me a good perspective of where all my hard work was going to.
