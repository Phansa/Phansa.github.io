<h1> GRE Vocabulary </h1>
<p> Here I will post GRE Vocabulary words that could be helpful to study! These are taken from the Google Search results
for the words and compiled here for your use. I will link to any other websites used to define these words as well. I am personally studying from flashcards and I will mark all defintions/sentences from these flashcards with a star *.</p>
<p> A good way to study GRE vocab words it to read literature. Reading literature will help you learn words in context
	as well as provide good practice for the reading comprehension portion of this exam. Novels written by classical
	writers are the best for this purpose, however you should read what you are interested in. Reading an article a day
	or more from these following sites will also help you improve you vocabulary.
